# ASTViewer
CDT ASTViewer(DOMAST) is Eclipse plugin originally developed by Eclipse CDT community. But this viewer is not included in org.eclipse.cdt package. so to use it, we have to download org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests source code and build it. So I cut unnecessary codes do some housekeeping made a new plugin. aka CDT ASTViewer.
all credits are for Eclipse CDT Community.
